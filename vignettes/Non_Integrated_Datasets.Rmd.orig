Many studies include data from assays which have not been integrated into the DataSpace. Some of these are available as "Non-Integrated Datasets," which can be downloaded from the app as a zip file. `DataSpaceR` provides an interface for accessing non-integrated data from studies where it is available.

## Viewing available non-integrated data

Methods on the DataSpace Study object allow you to see what non-integrated data may be available before downloading it. We will be using HVTN 505 as an example.

```{r getStudy}
library(DataSpaceR)
con <- connectDS()
vtn505 <- con$getStudy("vtn505")
vtn505
```

The print method on the study object will list available non-integrated datasets. The `availableDatasets` property shows some more info about available datasets, with the `integrated` field indicating whether the data is integrated. The value for `n` will be `NA` for non-integrated data until the dataset has been loaded.

```{r availableStudies}
knitr::kable(vtn505$availableDatasets)
```

## Loading non-integrated data

Non-Integrated datasets can be loaded with `getDataset` like integrated data. This will unzip the non-integrated data to a temp directory and load it into the environment.

```{r getDataset}
adcp <- vtn505$getDataset("ADCP")
dim(adcp)
colnames(adcp)
```

You can also view the file format info using `getDatasetDescription`. For non-integrated data, this will open a pdf into your computer's default pdf viewer.

```{r getDatasetDescription, eval = FALSE}
vtn505$getDatasetDescription("ADCP")
```

Non-integrated data is downloaded to a temp directory by default. There are a couple of ways to override this if desired. One is to specify `outputDir` when calling `getDataset` or `getDatasetDescription`.

If you will be accessing the data at another time and don't want to have to re-download it, you can change the default directory for the whole study object with `setDataDir`.

```{r setDataDir}
vtn505$dataDir
vtn505$setDataDir(".")
vtn505$dataDir
```

If the dataset already exists in the specified `dataDir` or `outputDir`, it will be not be downloaded. This can be overridden with `reload=TRUE`, which forces a re-download.


## Session information

```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```

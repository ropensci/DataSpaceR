This package provides a thin wrapper around [Rlabkey](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rlabkey) and connects to the the [CAVD DataSpace](https://dataspace.cavd.org) database, making it easier to fetch datasets from specific studies.

## Configuration

First, go to [DataSpace](https://dataspace.cavd.org) now and set yourself up with an account.

In order to connect to the CAVD DataSpace via `DataSpaceR`, you will need a `netrc` file in your home directory that will contain a `machine` name (hostname of DataSpace), and `login` and `password`. There are two ways to create a `netrc` file.

### Creating a netrc file with `writeNetrc`

On your R console, create a `netrc` file using a function from `DataSpaceR`:


```r
writeNetrc(
  login = "yourEmail@address.com",
  password = "yourSecretPassword",
  netrcFile = "/your/home/directory/.netrc" # use getNetrcPath() to get the default path
)
```

This will create a `netrc` file in your home directory. Make sure you have a valid login and password.

### Manually creating a netrc file

***Alternatively***, you can manually create a netrc file.

* On Windows, this file should be named `_netrc`
* On UNIX/Mac, it should be named `.netrc`
* The file should be located in the user's home directory, and the permissions on the file should be unreadable for everybody except the owner
* To determine your home directory, run `Sys.getenv("HOME")` in R

The following three lines must be included in the `.netrc` or `_netrc` file either separated by white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) or commas. Multiple such blocks can exist in one file.

```
machine dataspace.cavd.org
login myuser@domain.com
password supersecretpassword
```

See [here](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=netrc) for more information about `netrc`.


## Initiate a connection

We'll be looking at study `cvd256`. If you want to use a different study, change that string. You can instantiate multiple connections to different studies simultaneously.


```r
library(DataSpaceR)
#> By exporting data from the CAVD DataSpace, you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use available on the CAVD DataSpace sign-in page at https://dataspace.cavd.org
con <- connectDS()
con
#> <DataSpaceConnection>
#>   URL: https://dataspace.cavd.org
#>   User: jkim2345@scharp.org
#>   Available studies: 273
#>     - 77 studies with data
#>     - 5049 subjects
#>     - 423195 data points
#>   Available groups: 6
#>   Available publications: 1530
#>     - 12 publications with data
```

The call to `connectDS` instantiates the connection. Printing the object shows where it's connected and the available studies.


```r
knitr::kable(con$availableStudies)
```

The *cvd256* object is an [`R6`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6) class, so it behaves like a true object. Functions (like `getDataset`) are members of the object, thus the `$` semantics to access member functions.

We can get detailed variable information using `getDatasetDescription`. `getDataset` and `getDatasetDescription` accept either the `name` or `label` field listed in `availableDatasets`.

To get only a subset of the data and speed up the download, filters can be passed to `getDataset`. The filters are created using the `makeFilter` function of the `Rlabkey` package.


```r
cvd256Filter <- makeFilter(c("visit_day", "EQUAL", "0"))
NAb_day0 <- cvd256$getDataset("NAb", colFilter = cvd256Filter)
dim(NAb_day0)
#> [1] 709  33
```

See `?makeFilter` for more information on the syntax.


## Creating a connection to all studies

To fetch data from multiple studies, create a connection at the project level.


```r
cavd <- con$getStudy("")
```

This will instantiate a connection at the `CAVD` level. Most functions work cross study connections just like they do on single studies.

You can get a list of datasets available across all studies.


```r
cavd
#> <DataSpaceStudy>
#>   Study: CAVD
#>   URL: https://dataspace.cavd.org/CAVD
#>   Available datasets:
#>     - Binding Ab multiplex assay
#>     - Demographics
#>     - Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot
#>     - Intracellular Cytokine Staining
#>     - Neutralizing antibody
#>     - PK MAb
#>   Available non-integrated datasets:
knitr::kable(cavd$availableDatasets)
```

In all-study connection, `getDataset` will combine the requested datasets. Note that in most cases, the datasets will have too many subjects for quick data transfer, making filtering of the data a necessity. The `colFilter` argument can be used here, as described in the `getDataset` section.

## Connect to a saved group

A group is a curated collection of participants from filtering of treatments, products, studies, or species, and it is created in [the DataSpace App](https://dataspace.cavd.org/cds/CAVD/app.view).

Let's say you are using the App to filter and visualize data and want to save them for later or explore in R with `DataSpaceR`. You can save a group by clicking the Save button on the Active Filter Panel.

We can browse available the saved groups or the curated groups by DataSpace Team via `availableGroups`.


```r
knitr::kable(con$availableGroups)
```

To fetch data from a saved group, create a connection at the project level with a group ID. For example, we can connect to the "NYVAC durability comparison" group which has group ID 220 by `getGroup`.


```r
nyvac <- con$getGroup(220)
nyvac
#> <DataSpaceStudy>
#>   Group: NYVAC durability comparison
#>   URL: https://dataspace.cavd.org/CAVD
#>   Available datasets:
#>     - Binding Ab multiplex assay
#>     - Demographics
#>     - Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot
#>     - Intracellular Cytokine Staining
#>     - Neutralizing antibody
#>   Available non-integrated datasets:
```

Retrieving a dataset is the same as before.


```r
NAb_nyvac <- nyvac$getDataset("NAb")
dim(NAb_nyvac)
#> [1] 4281   33
```

## Access Virus Metadata

DataSpace maintains metadata about all viruses used in Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) assays. This data can be accessed through the app on the [NAb antigen page](https://dataspace.cavd.org/cds/CAVD/app.view#learn/learn/Assay/NAB/antigens) and [NAb MAb antigen page](https://dataspace.cavd.org/cds/CAVD/app.view#learn/learn/Assay/NAB%20MAB/antigens).

We can access this metadata in `DataSpaceR` with `con$virusMetadata`:


```r
knitr::kable(con$virusMetadata)
```

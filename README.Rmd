`DataSpaceR` is an R interface to [the CAVD DataSpace](https://dataspace.cavd.org), a data sharing and discovery tool that facilitates exploration of HIV immunological data from pre-clinical and clinical HIV vaccine studies.

This package simplifies access to the database by taking advantage of the standardization of the database to hide all the [Rlabkey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlabkey/index.html) specific code away from the user, and it allows the users to access the study-specific datasets via an object-oriented paradigm.


## Installation

You can install the latest version of DataSpaceR from [GitHub](https://github.com/CAVDDataSpace/DataSpaceR) with [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CAVDDataSpace/DataSpaceR")
```


## Register and set DataSpace credential

The database is accessed with the user's credentials. A netrc file storing 
login and password information is ***required***.

1. [Create an account](https://dataspace.cavd.org/) and read the terms of use
1. On your R console, create a netrc file using a function from `DataSpaceR`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DataSpaceR::writeNetrc("yourEmail@address.com", "yourSecretPassword")
```

This will create a netrc file in your home directory.

***Alternatively***, you can manually create a netrc file in the computer running R.

* On Windows, this file sould be named `_netrc`
* On UNIX, it should be named `.netrc`
* The file should be located in the user's home directory, and the permissions on the file should be unreadable for everybody except the owner
* To determine home directory, run `Sys.getenv("HOME")` in R

The following three lines must be included in the `.netrc` or `_netrc` file either separated by white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) or commas. Multiple such blocks can exist in one file.

```
machine dataspace.cavd.org
login myuser@domain.com
password supersecretpassword
```

See [here](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=netrc) for more information about `netrc`.


## Usage

The general idea is that the user:

1. creates an instance of `DataSpaceConnection` class via `connectDS`
1. browses available studies and groups in the instance via `availableStudies` and `availableGroups`
1. creates a connection to a specific study via `getStudy` or a group via `getGroup`
1. retrieves datasets by name via `getDataset`


### for example:

```{r}
library(DataSpaceR)

con <- connectDS()
con
```

`connectDS()` will create a connection to DataSpace.


### available studies can be listed by `availableStudies` field

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(con$availableStudies))
```


### available groups can be listed by `availableGroups` field

```{r}
knitr::kable(con$availableGroups)
```


### create an instance of `cvd408`

```{r}
cvd408 <- con$getStudy("cvd408")
cvd408
class(cvd408)
```


### available datasets can be listed by `availableDatasets` field

```{r}
knitr::kable(cvd408$availableDatasets)
```

which will print names of available datasets.


### Neutralizing Antibody dataset (`NAb`) can be retreived by:

```{r}
NAb <- cvd408$getDataset("NAb")
dim(NAb)
colnames(NAb)
```

The package uses a [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/index.html) class to represent the connection to a study and get around some of R's copy-on-change behaviour.
